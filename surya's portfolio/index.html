        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a motivated BCA graduate (2020) with diverse experience in technical operations, entrepreneurship, and
            customer relationship management. I began my career as a Fiber Associate Engineer, then successfully ran my
            own car wash business for three years, gaining leadership and operational skills. Later, I worked as a
            Customer Relationship Executive in a BPO, strengthening my communication abilities. Now, I am committed to
            building a career in Information Technology, aligned with my passion for technology, problem-solving, and
            innovation. I am upskilling in IT Support, Software Testing, Cloud Computing, and Data Analytics to achieve
            a future-ready career. With my technical background, entrepreneurial spirit, and customer-first mindset, I
            aim to be a valuable asset to any organization. Open to roles in IT Support, Cross-Platform Development,
            Software Testing, Customer Success, and other entry-level IT opportunities.</p><br>
        <p>I am passionate about web development, creative coding, and UI/UX design. I love experimenting with new ideas
            and bringing concepts to life!</p>
